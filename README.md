# WPF Desktop Application Architecture Patterns

Welcome to my repository for exploring various architecture patterns for WPF desktop applications! I will be creating sample applications for each of the six architecture patterns listed below. My goal is to provide a demonstration of what each pattern could look like in a WPF application, and to help me decide which patterns might be the best fit for my other projects.

Each architecture pattern has its own unique strengths and weaknesses, and is suited to different types of applications.

I hope this repository will be a useful resource for anyone else who is also exploring the world of WPF desktop application architecture patterns. Happy coding!

## Architecture Types

Here are the six architecture patterns I'll be exploring in this repository:

- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- MVC (Model-View-Controller)
- MVP (Model-View-Presenter)
- Passive View
- Event Aggregator
- Command Pattern
